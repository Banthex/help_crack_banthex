2. Use your registered username when prompted by the `help_crack_banthex.py` script.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Please note: The code may not be optimized and does not necessarily follow best practices, as it is developed by a hobby programmer.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Additional Information

- This change only adds credits to a leaderboard.
- The script works with the Stanev website.
- The MySQL for hashes is on WPA-SEC, not on Banthex.de. Only the leaderboard is on Banthex.de.

## üîß Setting Maximum GPU Temperature

To set the maximum GPU temperature, follow these steps:

1. When prompted, choose whether to disable hardware monitoring.
2. If you choose not to disable hardware monitoring, you will be prompted to enter the maximum GPU temperature (in degrees Celsius).
3. The script will use the `--gpu-temp-abort` option with the value you provide to set the maximum GPU temperature.
